        Allow a column value to be calculated by a number of expressions, the first expression returning a non NULL value is returned as the column value.
      Syntax:
        COALESCE (value {, value} ... )
      Notes:
        1. COALESCE (V1, V2) is equivalent to the following case specification:
             CASE WHEN V1 IS NOT NULL THEN V1 ELSE V2 END
        2. COALESCE (V1, V2, ..., Vn), for n >= 3, is equivalent to the following case specification:
             CASE WHEN V1 IS NOT NULL THEN V1 ELSE COALESCE (V2, ..., Vn) END
        3. The function has the same meaning as NVL one in Oracle.
      Example:
        SELECT
          PROJ_NAME AS Projectname,
          COALESCE(e.FULL_NAME, '[> not assigned <]') AS Employeename

      Note:
        NULLIF (V1, V2) is equivalent to the following case specification:
          CASE WHEN V1 = V2 THEN NULL ELSE V1 END
      Example:
        UPDATE PRODUCTS
          SET STOCK = NULLIF(STOCK, 0)
      Contributor(s):
        Arno Brinkman <firebird@abvisie.nl>

    * New CASE internal function (SF #451917).
        Allow the result of a column to be determined by a the results of a case expression.
      Syntax:
        <case_specification> = <simple_case> | <searched_case>

        <simple_case> = CASE value <simple_when_clause> ... [ELSE value] END
        <simple_when_clause> = WHEN value THEN value

        <searched_case> = CASE <searched_when_clause> ... [ELSE value] END
        <searched_when_clause> = WHEN <search_condition> THEN value
      Note:
        The function has the same meaning as DECODE one in Oracle.
      Examples:
        1. Simple case:
          SELECT
            o.ID,
            o.Description,
            CASE o.Status
              WHEN 1 THEN 'confirmed'

              WHEN 3 THEN 'ready'
              WHEN 4 THEN 'shipped'
              ELSE 'unknown status ''' || o.Status || ''''
            END
          FROM
            Orders o
        2. Searched case:
          SELECT
            o.ID,
            o.Description,
            CASE
              WHEN (o.Status IS NULL) THEN 'new'
              WHEN (o.Status = 1) THEN 'confirmed'
              WHEN (o.Status = 3) THEN 'in production'
              WHEN (o.Status = 4) THEN 'ready'
              WHEN (o.Status = 5) THEN 'shipped'

        If SORT plan is used for a SQL statement, the sorting is done in memory.
        If there's not enough memory for this operation, old temporary file based method is used.

    * New EXECUTE VARCHAR statement (SF #446256).
        Allow execution of dynamic SQL statements in SPs/triggers.

        EXECUTE VARCHAR value;
      Notes:
        1. Available in PSQL only.
        2. Currently cannot return values, so SELECT statements are not allowed.
        3. Recursion level is limited to 50 (hardcoded).
      Example:
        EXECUTE VARCHAR my_var;
