Introduction
============

Welcome to Firebird 2.1.


Intended Users
==============

This release candidate is intended for experienced
Firebird users. It has been reasonably well tested and
all new features should now be properly documented.

Do not use this release in a production environment.


Known Issues
============

Windows Vista - The binary installer fails to start
Firebird as a service at installation time, however,
the service does start correctly after a reboot. As a
workaround, you can shift-right click on the Firebird
control panel applet, choose 'Run as...' and start the
service from there.


Features in this release
========================

Please see the Release Notes for details of new
features.


Installation
============

Installation issues are covered in detail in the
Installation Guide available in the doc directory after
install. A brief summary of installation issues can
also be found in the installation_readme.txt, also
available from the doc directory after installation.


Reporting Bugs
==============

Before you report a bug:

 o Check you know how Firebird works.
   Maybe it is not a bug at all.

 o Perhaps some has already reported this? Browse
   existing bug reports here:

	http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/secure/BrowseProject.jspa

 o If in doubt why not discuss the problem on the
   Firebird-devel list? You can subscribe here:

	http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/firebird-devel

   and the list is viewable via a newsgroup interface
   here:

	news://news.atkin.com/


Please don't use the Firebird-devel list for technical
support unless the question specifically relates to a
new feature in Firebird 2.1


Happy Testing!

From the Firebird team.
