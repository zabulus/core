For classic server there are two ways to support multiple connections:
multyprocess (traditional for FB classic server) and multythread (new for FB 2.5).

Multyprocess mode is specially reliable cause error in one process does not affect others.
Multythread minimizes OS load and should provide better scalability under high loads.
