#-----------------------------------------------------------
# Amongst a number of makefiles some of the targets have
# specific rules. Rather than duplicate the rules in a 
# number of makefiles, these have been included here.
# 
# Hopefully this file is an intermediate step, on the way to 
# potentially a single makefile, or at least one per directory.

# This is the one where dyn_def.epp produced dyn_def.cpp and then the sed
# script is run to remove a component of it.  This is pretty ugly, and even
# if we have to live with it, the makefile should be changed to make the
# dependencies clearer. MOD July-2001
