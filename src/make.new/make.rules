# Most of the libraries and programs are linked using the dynamic linker
# We default to using the dynamic linker and have a special link macros for
# using the static linker.  
#
# Also libtool looks like the future in cross platform shared object compile
# and linking, but unfortunately it does not yet work for us, as a 
# libtool gcc -o $(BIN)/fred fred.o libzzz.la 
# command will generate incorrect relative addresses in the wrapper script in
# $(BIN)/fred as it required the exe file fred to be in the directory from
# which the command is run from.
# One other issue is that libtool puts a -DPIC onto the compile line.  While
# nice it conflicts with a struct in the file qli/format.h
# MOD 26-July-2001.
