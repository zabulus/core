                 Instructions for Building a Kit

 1.  Create a top level directory
 2.  cd to the top level directory and copy shell script setup_dirs
     into it.  setup_dirs can be found in marion under the builds
     component.  A no more than day old copy should also be located
     in /usr/gds/dev/HP700/original/setup_dirs on the HP's.
 3.  Run setup_dirs (you may need to "chmod +x setup_dirs" first)
 3.a Perform steps 3.a-3.d only if you received messages indicating
     that setup_dirs failed.  cd to system_id/original and copy into
     it, all files from the builds component in marion.  No more than
     day old copies should be available in /usr/gds/dev/HP700/original/*
     on the HP's.
 3.b Run setup_prots (you may need to "chmod +x setup_prots" first)
 3.c Run platform
 3.d cd ../..
 4.a Perform this step only if you are creating the master source
     tree for a new kit on the Apollos.  Run HP700/original/setup_gdbs.
     Then create the marion database for the kit.  Do not run
     setup_gdbs if there is a marion.gdb present.  It will delete it!
 4.b Perfom this step only if your are creating a new source tree on SCO.
     Copy the file 87ftol.o and _fltused.o from the current dev tree on
     SCO (goofy:/usr/gds/dev/jrd) or other SCO source tree. 
 5.  Copy gpre to interbase/bin
     Copy isc_license.dat to interbase
     Copy interbase.msg to interbase
     Copy gds_pipe to interbase/bin if the machine doesn't have shared
     libraries.
     Copy gds.sl, gds.so.0, or whatever the shared library is called to
     interbase/lib if the machine does have shared libraries.
 6.  Run refresh.all
 7.  Run build_kit

*** How to build an InterBase release kit on an UNIX platform ***

Modified by: B.Sriram 07-Mar-1997
Created by:  B.Sriram 15-May-1996

Pre-requisites:
##############
	- An installed interbase kit in the build machine.
	  ( this will allow us to use 'gpre', marion etc. )

Assumptions:
############
	- You are logged into the 'build' machine for the respective
	  platform. The build machines currently used are mentioned
	  at the bottom.
	- Create a /usr/gds.<hostname> directory structure with 100 MB
	  free.
          a. /usr/gds.<hostname>/bin, tools, tmp etc.
	- Populate 'bin' directory, and make sure '/usr/gds/sbin
	  points to /usr/gds.<hostname>/bin
	- $BUILD_DIR_PARENT is the parent of the build directory.
	- $BUILD_DIR is the build directory.
	   For eg. p4.0c_hp for a preproduction kit on HP platform
	- $MARION_DIR is the pathname inclusive of the host which 
	  consists of the 'marion' database.
	- platform for build is HP10
	- kit is a pre-production kit

Actions to be followed:
######################
	- cd $BUILD_DIR_PARENT
	- mkdir $BUILD_DIR
	- cd $BUILD_DIR
	- marion -c builds -d $MARION_DIR/marion.gdb
	  smm> sm setup_dirs
	  smm> quit
	- chmod +x setup_dirs
	- setup_dirs HP10 PROD yoda:/usr/gds.yoda/dev [SUPER]
	  /* The 1st argument to 'setup_dirs' should be one of the 
	     valid platforms supported. Just run 'setup_dirs' with no
	     args. to get a list of valid platforms. */
          The 'SUPER' argument is to be supplied for a SUPERSERVER build
	- refresh.all           /* This will get the latest version of 
                                   all the source files from the 'marion' 
                                   database. */
	- touch dsql/parse.c    /* so as not to run YACC.cosmetic requirement */
	- cp /usr/interbase/bin/gpre interbase/bin
	- cp /usr/interbase/lib/gds.sl interbase/lib
	                        /* Copy 'gpre' and the shared library for 
                                   pre-processing Embedded SQL code. 'makefile'
                                   access source/interbase/bin path */
	- cp /usr/interbase/{isc_license.dat,interbase.msg,isc4.gdb} interbase
	                        /* Required for 'gpre' to run */
	- cp /usr/interbase/lib/bridge5 interbase/lib
	                        /* Only on platforms that support BRIDGE */
	- cp /usr/gds/v4.0c_sc/interbase/bin/gds_pipe5 interbase/bin
	                        /* Only on SCO */
	- cd jrd
	- vi license.h          /* Edit and modify version string of product 
                                   release. For eg: from V4.0B to P4.0C on 
                                   all occurences of V4.0B */
	- make codes
	- codes                 /* This will create ibase.h and other needed 
                                   include files. */
	- cd ..
	- build_kit HP10
        - /* Remove un-neccessary files */
	- rm interbase/bin/gds_wal*
	  rm interbase/bin/gds_cache*
	- copy gds_pipe5 (bridge executable) from one of the 
          v4.0/interbase/bin directories. Also, copy lock_header_template 
          from v4.0/interbase
	- Copy the appropriate README file into the interbase/README file.
	- rasu set_prot /* Set protection on all to 'root' owner only */

    *** Various forms of delivery ***
        The kit can be delivered to QA/mftg in a number of different media.
        
        * Pre-production kit to be send as 'tar' files through our
          'FTP' site bekins.borland.com.
	  - maketar /* Shell script to invoke 'tar' and create a IB kit 
                       'tar' file. Before executing this script, edit it
                       and put the appropriate 'tar' filename */
	  - Inform QA about the location of the 'tar' file.
         
        * Kit for certification to QA/Mftg.

	  - maketape  /* Put the files and directories under interbase/
                         directory in 'tar' format in the tape. Before
                         executing this script, edit it and specify the 
                         proper device for the archive. */
          
                           --- OR ---
          - On some platforms we use 'pkg' utility. Read information about 
            this utility later on in this document OR view the document 
            /usr/gds/builder/pkg.README

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Useful Utilities :
################
	- rasu unset_prot builder
	  /* Gives all permission to 'builder' for all files. */
	- rasu set_prot 
	  /* Gives all permission only to 'root' for all files. */
	- maketar
	  /* exists on one of the kit directories. Edit and change 'tar'
	     filename. This command is to be executed to make a tar file
	     of the InterBase kit. */

         pkg.README
##################################################################

     pkgmk produces an installable package to be used as input to
     the pkgadd command. The command uses the package prototype file  
     as input and creates a pkgmap file. The contents for each entry 
     in the prototype file is copied to the appropriate output location.


     pkgproto scans the indicated paths and  generates  prototype
     file entries that may be used as input to the pkgmk command.
 
     pkgtrans translates an installable package from  one  format
     to another.  It translates:
          a file system format to a datastream
          a datastream to a file system format
          one file system format to another file system format
 

     pkgparam displays the value associated with the parameter or
     parameters  requested  on  the command line.  The values are
     located in either the pkginfo file for pkginst or  from  the
     specific file named with the -f option.

     pkginfo displays information about software  packages  which
     are  installed  on  the  system (with the first synopsis) or
     which reside on a particular device or directory  (with  the
     second synopsis). Here is a sample.

$ pkginfo -d `pwd`/pkg
application InterBase      Interbase RDBMS Software
$ pkginfo -l -d `pwd`/pkg
   PKGINST:  InterBase
      NAME:  Interbase RDBMS Software
  CATEGORY:  application
      ARCH:  sparc
   VERSION:  InterBase Version B4.0E
   BASEDIR:  /usr
    PSTAMP:  beta
    STATUS:  spooled
     FILES:    169 spooled pathnames
                 9 directories
                18 executables
                 4 setuid/setgid executables
                 5 package information files
             20947 blocks used (approx)
 
$ 

How to build a package:
----------------------

1. vi pkginfo  /* change version */ 
2. pkgproto `pwd`/interbase=\$IBASEDIR/interbase >> prototype 
       /* The $IBASEDIR in the path looks bogus. We should decide
          how that should be, and fix it up for the future. --cjewell */
3. Edit 'prototype' file and add to the beginning of the file:
i pkginfo
i request
i postinstall
i preremove
4. mkdir pkg 
5. pkgmk -d `pwd`/pkg -p beta
   --where beta is just any string label for the package instance?
6. pkgtrans `pwd`/pkg /dev/rmt/0m 
   --for tape reboot if necessary 

# Platforms currently using the 'pkg' format are:
# Solaris, DG/UX and NCR
